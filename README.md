    <h1>QuizWiz - A Quiz App with API Integration</h1>
</div>

<ul><li><strong>Description:</strong></li></ul>
<p>QuizWiz is a dynamic mobile quiz application that allows users to play quizzes across various categories. It utilizes an API to store user data, fetch questions, and track user performance in real-time. The app supports both single and group play modes, with the group play mode being implemented in the final POE. This application provides AI-generated explanations.</p>

<ul><li><strong style="font-size: 20px;">Functional Requirements:</strong></li></ul>
<p>The registration and login functionality in QuizWiz is powered by the Visual Studio API. The API handles user authentication, which allows users to securely create accounts, log in, and access their personalized data.</p>

<p>When users register, they are prompted to provide their name, email, and password, then click the signup button. Once the user is registered, they can log in to the application by providing their email and the registered password.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Technology Used:</strong></li></ul>
<p>QuizWiz follows a client-server architecture where the Android app (client) communicates with the backend API (server) to fetch quiz data, manage user accounts, and store results. Hereâ€™s an overview of the architecture:</p>

<ul><strong>Frontend: Android Studio Application</strong></ul>
<ul>
  <li>Built with Android Studio using Java/Kotlin.</li>
  <li>The app provides a user interface to interact with quizzes, show questions, submit answers, and display performance.</li>
  <li>The app sends and receives data from the backend API using HTTP requests, handled through Retrofit.</li>
  <li>User interactions like registration, login, quiz selection, and quiz submission are facilitated by API requests.</li>
</ul>

<ul><strong>Backend: ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio</strong></ul>
<ul>
  <li>Provides RESTful API endpoints for user registration, login, and fetching quizzes.</li>
  <li>Handles user authentication, quiz logic, and secure communication between the app and the database.</li>
  <li>Uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure session management, allowing only authenticated users to interact with the quiz system.</li>
</ul>

<ul><strong>Database: Cloud Firestore</strong></ul>
<ul>
  <li>Cloud Firestore is the NoSQL database used to store and retrieve user data and quiz content.</li>
  <li>Cloud Firestore is integrated into the backend API, where the server communicates with the database to store and fetch data.</li>
</ul>

<ul><strong>Data Structure (Cloud Firestore):</strong></ul>
<ul>
  <li>Users Collection: Stores user profile information such as username, email, password.</li>
  <li>Quiz Collection: Stores quiz questions, options, answers, and categories.</li>
</ul>
